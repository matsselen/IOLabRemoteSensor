\subsection{Detailed Description}
Board initialization module. {\bfseries Project} 1814 I\-O\-Lab Remote Sensor Application

{\bfseries Description} This file contains the board initialization function. This function must be called immediately after start-\/up to configure the system clocks, the G\-P\-I\-O pins, and the analog input pins.

Initializes the board to a good default state. This includes configuring the G\-P\-I\-O pins, system clocks, power management module (P\-M\-M), system interrupts, and the watchdog timer.

This should be one of the first Init functions called so that the board (in particular, the G\-P\-I\-O pins) are put in a good state A\-S\-A\-P.
